# OpenTK-VGE (OpenTK Voxel Game Engine)

OpenTK-VGE (OpenTK Voxel Game Engine) is an open-source voxel game engine project based on the OpenTK library. This engine has been developed to facilitate the creation of immersive and interactive 3D voxel games.


<h2>Key Features (In Development)</h2>
Voxel Rendering: OpenTK-VGE provides full support for rendering voxel worlds, allowing the creation of vast and detailed environments with 3D blocks.

Advanced Physics: The engine includes a physics system that enables realistic collision, gravity, and interactive interactions between game objects.

Texture Mapping: Custom textures can be mapped onto voxel blocks to add variety and visual details to the game environments.

Flexible Controls: OpenTK-VGE supports various input controls such as keyboard, mouse, and gamepad, making gameplay and player interaction with the game world seamless.

Scripting: Extending the functionality of OpenTK-VGE is possible using C# scripts, allowing the creation of custom behaviors for characters, objects, and game events.

Cross-Platform: OpenTK-VGE is compatible with multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, ensuring that your voxel game can run on different operating systems.

Please note that the Key Features section is currently under development and subject to change.
